A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several
kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. Cool! I could go on and on here, but I won't.  I will just end this and see what it looks like.  I expect I need to do a lot of work here to make this much better.

In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains",
distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft
flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow,
red, purple, or brown when ripe.

```swift
public class Test {
    let x = 5
    var running = false

    public func runTest() {
        running = true
    }
}
```
